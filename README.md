# Dependencies
- Written in Python 3.9.13
- random, collections, math, itertools, matplotlib
# Running the Code
- Source code must be in same directory as test and train folders (did not include in submission due to size)
- Must include my version of ```utils.py``` in same directory
- Original file is ```hw2_run.ipynb```, if you are able running all code cells like this is ideal
- Otherwise, running  ```hw2_run_script.py``` in a directory containing previously mentioned files will run all code at once through Python.
  - When running the script, close the Alpha vs Accuracy graph to continue running the code
